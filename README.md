## ✨ Rasha | Frontend Developer ✨  
*Turning pixels into polished experiences*

Hey there 👋 I'm Rasha — a frontend developer who believes that good design isn’t just how it looks, but how it *feels*.  
I blend code with creativity to build clean, responsive, and user-focused web interfaces.  

I don’t just write HTML & CSS — I shape user journeys, one interaction at a time.
